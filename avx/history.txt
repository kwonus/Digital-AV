HISTORY:

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 66 - Version 7.0.2011.66 - 4 Aug 2011   (AV-2011)
-------------------------------------------------------
Build 66 retores functionality of the "Names" browser.

PLEASE NOTE:
AV 2011 no longer provides the Microsoft Word plugin
as was provided in previous AV Bible releases.  Install
AV 2007 if you need integration with Microsoft Word:
Version 7 and Version 5.4 can both be installed on the
same machine.  Watch the RTBible.com web site as they
anticipate releasing a plugin for Word 2007/2010 built
upon the same texts of the AV SDK 2011.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 65 - Version 7.0.2011.65 - 3 Aug 2011   (AV-2011)
-------------------------------------------------------
Build 65 is the first production release of AV Bible
built with the newly released AV SDK.  The resulting
text is an acurate representation of the original 1611
text.  Build 65 is also the first version built using
Delphi 2009 (previous releases were built using Delphi
2006).  The transition to AV-2011 is a major facelift
from AV-2007:  the facelift is not merely asthetic as
it provides much simplified searching when compared to
earlier releases.

Unfortunately, this release sees the departure of the
Microsoft Word plugin.  Install version 5.4 if you need
integration with Microsoft Word.  Version 7 and Version
5.4 can both be installed on the same machine.  Watch
the RTBible.com web site as they anticipate releasing a
plugin for Word 2007/2010 built upon the AV SDK 2011.

-------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 45i - Version 4.0::RC1 - 4 August 2004  (AV-2004)
-------------------------------------------------------
Total overhaul of the AV text engine. Original design
dated back to the original AV-1996 implementation. The
new library is file-based. This file-based structure
provides an easier migration for Mac OS X support.
Numerous bugs were fixed from the earlier 3.0 release:
The 3.0 release never really met production standards.
The 4.0 release (RC1) is now a solid release candidate.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 44 - Version 3.0 - 25 March 2004        (AV-2004)
-------------------------------------------------------
Major Revision to search engine, better memory manager
Numerous bugs. No longer supported. Upgrade to Version
4.0 or revert to AV-2000.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 43 - Version 2.3.5::GRC6 - 25 July 2003 (AV-2003)
-------------------------------------------------------
Minor face-lift for the Large-Print icons. Also
corrected typos in some included help files.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 42 - Version 2.3.5::GRC5 - 23 July 2003 (AV-2003)
-------------------------------------------------------
Corrected bugs in the saving of program options and
updated the church directory (CDROM & Internet versions).
Also upgraded the floppy-disk installation program to
"inno" 3.06 (the same as used by the CDROM & Internet
installations, but with higher compression using bzip).

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 41 - Version 2.3.4::GRC4 - 11 July 2003 (AV-2003)
-------------------------------------------------------
Minor improvement to the Help System. Added link to
the license file from the help system. Golden-Release
candidate 4 (GRC4). This release has passed basic
acceptance testing on Windows-2000, Windows-98, and XP.
Fixed bug in names (especially those starting with the
letter 'S'). Also now allows random access to books
from the list view (by clicking on the bible). Also
fixed a couple of pop-up hints on a few buttons.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 40c - Version 2.3.2c - 2 July 2003      (AV-2003)
-------------------------------------------------------
HTTP Access was not available in Windows 95/98 of build
40. That capability has been restored in build 40c.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 40 - Version 2.3.2b - 1 July 2003       (AV-2003)
-------------------------------------------------------
HTTP Access was not available in Windows 2000 of build
39. That capability has been restored in build 40.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 39 - Version 2.3.2 - 30 June 2003       (AV-2003)
-------------------------------------------------------
Fixed the missing Genesis bug on new installations.
Also XP is automatically detected now and XP compatible
settings are automatically selected. Currently, the XP
edition of AV-2003 does not support HTTP access. There
will likely be a build 40 prior to GRC3 for this reason.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 38 - Version 2.3.1 - 24 June 2003       (AV-2003)
-------------------------------------------------------
2 John would not render correctly (1 John 1 was being
displayed instead). Also fixed the MS-Word integration:
inserting the last chapter of a book now inserts the
entire chapter (instead of just verse 1). Finally, in
MS-Word: Inserting verses now takes ranges (Lev 1:3-9)
Build 38 is Golden Release Candidate 2 (GRC2).

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 37 - Version 2.3 - 17 June 2003         (AV-2003)
-------------------------------------------------------
Minor cosmetic UI fixes. Also fixed a bug in the help
system. Build 37 is Golden Release Candidate 1 (GRC1).

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 36 - Version 2.2 - 21 May 2003          (AV-2003)
-------------------------------------------------------
Cleaned up some of the help documentaion. Also improved
the AV MDK, by adding the "Floppy Disk Creator" GUI.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 35 - Version 2.1.5 - 22 January 2003    (AV-2003)
-------------------------------------------------------
Cleaned up some of the help documentaion. Also improved
the AV MDK, by adding the "Floppy Disk Creator" GUI.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 34 - Version 2.1.4 - 18 January 2003    (AV-2003)
-------------------------------------------------------
Improvements in the tab to expose "Sensitivity"
and Strongs numbers. The best release yet, but probably
is not the final release candidate of AV-2003.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 33.X04 - Version 1.7.4 - 10 August 2004 (AV-2000)
-------------------------------------------------------
Minor installation refresh.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 33.X2K - Version 1.7 - 17 January 2003  (AV-2000)
-------------------------------------------------------
Back by popular demand; this is a refresh release of
AV-2000, but based on the AV-2002 texts. AV-2000 is
better suited for older machines with less processing
power and/or with less memory. AV-2000 also integrates
more seamlessly with Word-95. Default registry values
have been changed so as to not collide with AV-2003
installations on the same machine.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 33b - Version 2.1.2 - 2 January 2003    (AV-2002)
-------------------------------------------------------
No functional changes in AV-2002 program files, but the
Floppy installation and the Media Distribution Kit (MDK)
were missing the third floppy disk. AV-2002 is once
again a two(2) diskette set.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 33 - Version 2.1.1 - 29 December 2002   (AV-2002)
-------------------------------------------------------
Restored the publish bible text by right-clicking as per
instructions. Not sure which version of AV-2002 that
this feature had disappeared in, but it is restored in
build 33.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 32 - Version 2.1 - 27 December 2002     (AV-2002)
-------------------------------------------------------
Restored the ability to search on Hebrew words in the
Old Testament. Also updated the appearance of all tree
controls throughout the application.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 31 - Version 2-RC3 - 22 December 2002   (AV-2002)
-------------------------------------------------------
Fixed Problems related to Windows XP and Office XP.
Fixed severe problems with MS-Word Integration. XP must
"Use HTML Files" instead of the new embedded HTTP server.
Never released on the Web: limited CDROM distribution
only (Merry Christmas Edition 2002).

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 30 - Version 2-RC2 - 14 December 2002   (AV-2002)
-------------------------------------------------------
Fixed some quirky behavior of RC1, especially in the
Search Form.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 29 - Version 2-RC1 - 4 December 2002    (AV-2002)
-------------------------------------------------------
The 2.0 release is the first version of the AV Bible
programs that does not require the 30 megabytes of HTML
files to be resident on the hard disk. This new design
deploys an AV Bible Server (accessible from any browser
on port 1611; e.g. http://mycomputer:1611/) along with
the updated version. This software uses the same KJV
"SWORD" texts as first deployed in build 28. These
texts are derived (and therefore substantially similar)
to the texts of the "Online Bible".

Builds 28 and above are built with Delphi 6.0 Personal,
while the bible data is still built with Visual C++ 6.0.
The author highly recommends that you replace any AV-2000
and AV-1999 installations with this latest release.

NOTE:
Version 2.0 includes a directory of Independent Baptist
Churches. The program author has noticed that only
Baptist churches (but not all Baptist churches) believe
that the King James Bible is God's Word to mankind in
the English Language (1 Thessalonians 2:13). The
directory is not part of AV-2002, but a bible-believer
belongs in a bible-believing church. The directory of
churches is provided for those who may be searching for
a bible-believing church.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 28 - Version 1.6 - 29 September 2002    (AV-2002)
-------------------------------------------------------
Build 28 was a limited release. The main purpose of the
1.6 release is to supply updates to errors found in the
AV-2000 texts. A bible-believer in Texas discovered an
error anytime counselor appeared in the text. The new,
updated texts are derived from the "SWORD" project. The
project is hosted on the web at:
http://www.crosswire.org/sword/
and
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sword/

The "SWORD" bible program identified on the sites sited
above is not incorporated into AV-2002. AV-2002 only
uses the KJV text from that "open-source" (community)
development effort.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 27 - Version 1.5.v - 2 September 2001   (AV-2000)
-------------------------------------------------------
Copyright refresh. Added CDROM Edition. The Internet
Edition now includes "AV-Intructions.doc" (as does the
new CDROM Edition). The CDROM distribution includes
the AV-MDK so that redistribution of AV-2000 on the
2-disk floppy set is facilitated. AV-MDK is not part
of the default installation. Its setup program must be
invoked explicity if you wish to redistribute AV-2000
on 1.44mb floppies. Finally, the Setup program is
produced by Inno 2.0.13 (instead of Inno 1.3.x).

NOTE: There was never an AV-2001 edition as updates
performed during that year were mostly cosmetic
and/or related to redistribution of AV-2000.

-------------------------------------------------------
Builds 23-26 - Version 1.5.i* - 6-10 Feb 2000 (AV-2000)
-------------------------------------------------------
1.5.i: Fixed quirky behavior on the search screen when
turning off search via the check-box. Added the AV-2000
upgrade edition to the product family.

1.5.ii: Fixed reloading of last known search criteria.

1.5.iii: History mechanism has been refined.

1.5.iv: Minor revisions to release/readme notes.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 22 - Version 1.5 - 2 February 2000      (AV-2000)
-------------------------------------------------------
Fixed bugs relating to inserting verses by book names
such as Joshua and Judges has been fixed. This bug was
most noticable in the MS-Word integration.

-------------------------------------------------------
Builds 20,21 - Version 1.2x - 22-25 January 2000
-------------------------------------------------------
Improved user interface. Added the ability to browse
proper names. Fixed some problems with browsing proper
names.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 19 - Version 1.11 - 21 January 2000
-------------------------------------------------------
Build 18's reliance upon Delphi 5 was premature. Build
19-27 reverted to the Delphi 3 compiler. Build 19 added
the ability to publish RTF documents (comapatible with
Microsoft Word).

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 18 - Version 1.1 - 15 January 2000
-------------------------------------------------------
A major bug was discovered by an AV-1999 user. AV-1999
Build 17 and earlier did not allow you to view chapters
greater than 99. Sounds like a Y2K bug and though it
was not, it was similar. Build 18 is also the first
version compiled under Delphi 5 (previous releases were
compiled with Delphi 3).

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 17                                      (AV-1999)
-------------------------------------------------------
Face lift for colors. Let me know if you like the old
colors better. Build 17 was mainly done to clean up
the documentation about Word97 support. Build 17 also
introduced the Microsoft Word "Integration Assistant".
This menu item assists you in integrating AV 1999 into
Word95, Word97, or Word2000. After integration, you
can search for bible text right from inside of MS-Word.
Build 17 also brought in a much improved AV MDK (Media
Distribution Kit) as separate installable product.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 16.xi                                   (AV-1999)
-------------------------------------------------------
This was supposed to be the last build before moving
onto to work on AV-2000. Added support for Word97.

-------------------------------------------------------
Build 16k                                     (AV-1999)
-------------------------------------------------------
Stable build, but could not be integrated with MS-Word.

NOTE:
There were numerous more builds dating all the the way
back to 1996 but cataloging of releases did not begin
until build 16k.
